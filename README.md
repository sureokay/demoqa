We need to ensure we have latest node, playwright, npm, vscode and applitools. With minimum version limit as follows

    - Playwright v1.35.1
    - Node v20.3.0
    - npm v9.6.5
    - VSCode Version: 1.79.1 (Universal)
    - Applitools v1.17.5

The project as Github actions setup by default for playwright hence every time a code is commited will trigger checks and generated reports can be found at the Summary section of the run as archived html reports.
